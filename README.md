# 🍽️ NOLA Eats — Conversational Restaurant Assistant

> *"Find a jazz brunch spot for a bachelorette party — festive, not touristy."*

A conversational restaurant assistant for New Orleans. Ask natural language questions, get named recommendations backed by actual reviewer quotes — powered by a hybrid of deterministic SQL filtering and semantic vector search over 621K real Yelp reviews.

> Inspired by [Amazon Rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus) — the conversational shopping assistant that answers natural language product questions using reviews, listings, and structured metadata. NOLA Eats applies the same pattern to restaurant discovery: an LLM Query Planner extracts structured intent, SQL handles enumerable facts, and semantic search over reviewer text handles everything a checkbox can't capture.

```

**Step 1 — SQL filter (structured precision).** The Query Planner parses the question into structured filters drawn from Yelp business attributes: noise level, price range, alcohol, outdoor seating, live music, good for groups, ambience, meal type, and more. This shrinks 1,199 restaurants to a precise candidate pool with 100% metadata accuracy.

**Step 2 — Semantic search (review-text ranking).** Within that candidate pool, vector similarity search over 621K embedded review snippets surfaces what no checkbox captures — food quality, atmosphere nuance, experience narratives, local knowledge. The Synthesizer turns the top evidence into a direct conversational answer, grounded only in what reviewers actually wrote.

> The SQL filter achieves deterministic precision before the semantic search runs. Vector search never crosses business boundaries — it operates only within the SQL-filtered candidate pool. This is the industry-standard *filtered vector search* pattern.

**Retrieval ranking:** Snippets are ranked by L2 distance (Euclidean) on 256-dim embeddings — ChromaDB's default; smallest distance = closest semantic match. The embedding model is `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` with MRL truncation to 256 dimensions, run locally via `mlx_embedding_models` (MPS). Asymmetric retrieval prefixes are applied: documents are embedded as `"search_document: " + text` at ingest time; queries are embedded as `"search_query: " + text` at runtime. This prefix pairing is required by the model for correct asymmetric retrieval — omitting it degrades quality. There is no re-ranking step on top of the bi-encoder retrieval.

## 📊 Dataset

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | Yelp Open Dataset — `business.json` + `review.json` |
| **Filter** | `city == "New Orleans"`, category contains `"Restaurant"`, `review_count > 50` |
| **Businesses** | 1,199 |
| **Reviews** | ~621K |
| **Ingest time** | ~30–45 min on M4 Pro (MPS) |

**Why New Orleans?** Its semantically rich review vocabulary — Creole, Cajun, po'boys, beignets, jazz brunch, second lines, Frenchmen Street — gives semantic retrieval real signal to work with. A query like *"late-night Cajun spot after a jazz show"* surfaces meaningfully different results than *"casual dinner."* City was selected after inspecting the actual dataset: Las Vegas is absent from this Yelp release.

See [docs/yelp_example.md](docs/yelp_example.md) for an annotated example of the raw `business.json` and `review.json` record formats, including the attribute encoding quirks the ingest pipeline handles.

## ⚡ Performance

All results on Apple M4 Pro, `mlx-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-4bit` via `mlx_lm.server` (MPS).

### Latency

| Stage | Warm |
|---|---:|
| Query Planner | ~880 ms |
| SQL filter | ~3 ms |
| Retrieval | ~900 ms |
| Synthesizer | ~2,200 ms |
| **End-to-end** | **~4,100 ms** |

**Warm p50: ~4.1s** — 3.6× under the <15s target. Achieved across 20 experiments: key wins were switching to a 4-bit quantized model (2.6× speedup), eliminating a redundant per-request ChromaDB scan, and a dummy-query warmup at startup to pre-load the HNSW index into RAM. Full experiment log: [experiments.md](docs/experiments.md).

### Query Planning Accuracy

20-query eval set covering all three intent types:

| Intent | Result |
|---|---|
| `find_businesses` (14 queries) | 14 / 14 ✓ |
| `question_about_business` (4 queries) | 4 / 4 ✓ |
| `compare_businesses` (2 queries) | 2 / 2 ✓ |
| **Total** | **20 / 20 — 100%** |

Hallucination guard verified: occasion words (`"bachelor party"`, `"date night"`) do not trigger spurious `attire`, `ambience`, or `noise_level` filters.

### Synthesizer Faithfulness

RAGAS faithfulness eval — 14 `find_businesses` queries, judged by Gemini 2.5 Pro. Metric: fraction of answer claims supported by retrieved review evidence.

| | Score |
|---|---:|
| **Mean faithfulness** | **0.831** |
| Queries scoring ≥ 0.80 | 10 / 14 |
| Perfect scores (1.00) | 3 / 14 |

During evaluation, a false negative bias was identified: RAGAS marked business names and SQL-only attributes (e.g. `dogs_allowed`, `byob`) as ungrounded because they never appear in anonymous review text. Fixed by (1) injecting serialised business metadata into the eval context and (2) prefixing each snippet with its business name — giving the judge visibility into both data sources the synthesizer uses. Raw baseline was 0.501; corrected score is 0.831.

### Load Test — 5 concurrent users, 300s

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Warm p50 | 19,000 ms |
| Warm p95 | 26,000 ms |
| Error rate | **0%** |
| Throughput | 0.18 req/s |

Tested with two `mlx_lm.server` instances behind a round-robin proxy. Latency under concurrent load is queue-induced (serial LLM inference), not pipeline latency — single-user warm p50 remains 4.1s.

## 🗂️ SQL Filter Fields

Fields parsed from Yelp business attributes and used as structured filters:

| Type | Fields |
|---|---|
| Scalar | `noise_level`, `price_range`, `alcohol`, `attire`, `wifi`, `smoking` |
| Boolean | `good_for_groups`, `outdoor_seating`, `takes_reservations`, `good_for_kids`, `good_for_dancing`, `happy_hour`, `has_tv`, `caters`, `wheelchair_accessible`, `dogs_allowed`, `byob`, `corkage` |
| JSON sub-keys | `ambience` (romantic/classy/hipster/…), `good_for_meal` (brunch/latenight/…), `music` (live/dj/…), `parking` (garage/valet/…) |

SQL handles *structured, enumerable facts*. Semantic search handles everything that only lives in what reviewers actually wrote.

## 🛡️ Security

The Query Planner is an LLM — its output is treated as **untrusted** at the SQL boundary.

- **SQL injection prevention** — LLM-generated field names are validated against explicit whitelists (`_BOOLEAN_FIELDS`, `_SCALAR_FIELDS`, `_JSON_FIELDS`) before any interpolation into SQL strings. JSON sub-keys are checked against per-field allowlists. Unrecognised fields are silently skipped. All values use SQLite parameterised queries — LLM output never touches a SQL string directly.
- **Input validation** — `question` on all request schemas enforces `max_length=2000` to prevent context exhaustion.
- **Session IDs** — generated server-side via `uuid.uuid4()`; unknown IDs start a fresh session rather than erroring.

---

## 🔒 Output Guardrails

LLM outputs are constrained at two stages of the pipeline.

**Query Planner**
- Pydantic schema validation on every LLM response — malformed or missing fields are rejected outright.
- Automatic retry with an explicit schema reminder on the first failure; a `ValueError` is raised if the second attempt also fails, preventing a bad plan from reaching the retrieval layer.
- Prompt-level anti-inference rules — occasion words (`"bachelor party"`, `"date night"`) are explicitly prohibited from triggering spurious SQL filters. Verified at 20/20 on the query eval set.

**Synthesizer**
- *Grounding* — the system prompt instructs the model to answer using only the retrieved review evidence and never invent details not present in the snippets.
- *Negative evidence handling* — if a review warns against a place for the user's use case, the model is instructed not to recommend it and may cite the reason.
- *Honesty on ambiguity* — mixed or ambiguous reviews must be reflected honestly rather than presented as positive recommendations.
- `temperature=0.0` — deterministic output; no creative drift.
- `max_tokens=300` — hard cap prevents generation runaway and keeps synthesizer latency within a predictable window.

**Measured effectiveness** — RAGAS faithfulness eval (Gemini 2.5 Pro judge, 14 queries): **0.831 mean faithfulness**. The score measures the fraction of answer claims that are grounded in the retrieved review evidence. See [docs/experiments.md](docs/experiments.md) (EXP-018 – EXP-020) for the full methodology and how a structural metric bias was identified and corrected.

## 🚀 Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, Apple Silicon (M-series)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # override LLM_BASE_URL if using a non-default port
```

---

## ▶️ Running

**1. Ingest** (one-time, ~30–45 min on M4 Pro):
```bash
python -m ingestion.ingest_nola \
  --business /path/to/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json \
  --review /path/to/yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
```

**2. Start LLM server (mlx_lm, Apple Silicon):**
```bash
.venv/bin/mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-4bit --port 8001
```

**3. Start API** (separate terminal):
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000
```

FastAPI startup pre-loads the embedding model and ChromaDB HNSW index before accepting requests — the first query won't absorb cold-start cost. Only the mlx_lm.server KV-cache warmup on the very first LLM call will still show up as cold overhead.

**4. Query:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "loud spot for a bachelor party that handles large groups"}'
```

**5. Load test** (separate terminal, requires API + LLM server running):
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/locust -f benchmarks/load_test.py \
  --host http://localhost:8000 \
  --users 5 --spawn-rate 1 --run-time 300s --headless
```

Stats are reported in four rows: `/api/v1/query [cold]`, `/api/v1/query [warm]` (HTTP round-trip), `server [cold]`, `server [warm]` (server-reported `latency_ms` from response body).

**6. RAGAS faithfulness eval** (requires API + LLM server running; `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`):
```bash
# Collect pipeline responses (saves to benchmarks/ragas_samples.json)
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python benchmarks/ragas_eval.py

# Run Gemini judge on saved samples (no servers needed)
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python benchmarks/ragas_eval.py --judge-only
```

## 🗺️ What's Next

Multi-turn session support (v2) — last 3 conversation turns injected into the Query Planner so it can resolve references like *"the first one"*, *"anything cheaper?"*, *"what about parking there?"*. In-memory session store, 30-min TTL.

Cross-encoder re-ranking — a second-stage ranker (e.g. `BAAI/bge-reranker-base`) that scores each `(query, snippet)` pair jointly before passing evidence to the Synthesizer. Bi-encoders (like the current nomic retrieval) are fast but approximate — they embed query and document independently. A cross-encoder attends across both texts together, producing more accurate relevance scores at the cost of ~100–300ms extra latency for 20 snippets on MPS.
